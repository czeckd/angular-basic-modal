# About the SVG files
The svg files were modified to remove the height and width attributes from the 
file per Sara Soueidan's advice in "[Making SVGs Responsive With 
CSS](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/08/19/making-svgs-responsive-with-css/)".

> In order to make an SVG fluid, the first logical thing to do is to remove the 
> height and width attributes. When a fixed height and/or width is specified, 
> the SVG is going to maintain that height/or width, thus restricting it from 
> being fully responsive. You should, however, leave the viewBox attribute 
> present. After removing the height and width, you can embed the SVG in one of 
> several ways on the page.

A fill color was also added for each SVG. The originals are found as part of the 
[Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG) 
library on GitHub at
